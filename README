Warning : only a draft, don't look for anything functional yet.

A node.js server and its client for running genetic algorithms across browsers. This is a pet project for experimenting with Web Workers, node.js, WebSockets and nice stuff like that.

Installing dependancies on my system (ubuntu):

$> sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
$> sudo npm install http-server -g
$> cd $sandbox$/javascript_genetic_algorithm/
$> sudo npm install websocket.io

Running a basic HTTP server to serve static resources (it will look for the 'public' directory):

$> http-server

Running the server for WebSockets communication:

$> nodejs ga_server.js

Open http://localhost:8080/html/manager.html and http://localhost:8080/html/client_example.html
